This is an example piece of documentation inside the documentation folder.
There's nothing particularly exciting about this, it just takes up space
and acts as an example as to where the documentation for anything should
go.

Folders can be added here and the contents will be read recursively by
the site, meaning that you can host several different projects on here
with folder separation.
