This is the Documentation Site project that was created for the use of
reading in markdown documentation files and outputting them to a screen
on a website. This came about because I wanted some way to easily read
markdown files that were associated with projects.

A running version of this site can be found at
[doc.m4numbers.co.uk](http://doc.m4numbers.co.uk).

##Installation

So, this is a site which is basically just a click-and-drag job. Once
the site has been dragged into your directory, wherever that may be,
you will need to pick up a copy of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
and run `php composer.phar install` within the root directory.

Once that is done, your site should be ready for use (with a few minor
adjustments for the homepage links and such and such).
